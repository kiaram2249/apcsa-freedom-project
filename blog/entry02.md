### Content

Over the past couple of months, I've been diving into **Godot** and learning how to create 2D games, despite some challenges along the way, like not being able to install it on my school computer. Instead, I started with the **Godot Web Editor**, where I worked on my first project, "_MyFirstProject_." I learned the basics of creating **scenes**, adding **sprites**, and even **animating** them. My first major breakthrough came when I figured out how to move a **sprite** using the arrow keys or the mouse with **GDScript**. I also explored platformer game mechanics, setting up **collision** shapes, **gravity**, and player movement using functions like ``_physics_process()``. As I progressed, I faced more complex features, like creating animated sprites, handling moving platforms, and even implementing scene changes. With each new feature, I felt more confident in using **Godot** tools, and it was exciting to see my ideas come to life. Right now, my main focus is on improving the player experience, refining the animations, and learning how to manage multiple scenes in a game, especially as I continue to work on my **Freedom Project**.

### Engineering Design Process

I'm slowly moving to steps 3 and 4, which are **breainstorming** and **planning**. While I've already learned the basics of using **Godot** by praticing, it's time to think about the direction of my partner and I game. We need to brainstorm because we need to consider all the key elements of the game, like the art style, the player mechanics, and how the user will interact with the game. For instance, I need to think about the type of character the player will control, what the game will look like, and how I can implemnent the movement and animations I've learned. Planning is also important now because we need to lay out a clear roadmap for the project. For instance, I could focus on defining the structure of the game, like how the scenes will transition. While my partner can focus on the level or challenges the player will face, or how we can ensure the game is both fun and functional. These steps are important because it will allow my partner and I to tie everything that we learned about **Godot** into a cohesive game plan, ensuring that the final product comes together smoothly. By planning out these details, it will make designing the game step-by-step more easier.

### Skills

#### Communication

**Communication** is very important for us because we all need to be at the same steps/the same part so that no one will be behind or ahead. Also, winter break is coming very soon, so it's important that we communicate with one another in order to stay in touch with each other about the project. So, it's a good thing that my partner and I can communicate with each other by using **Discord**. We can use discord in order to text each other while we're on break. However, I realized that my partners and I ain't communicating as much about the project stil. We still ain't checking up on each other, which isn't a good thing because we need to slowly start brainstorming and planning about our project and we need to show each other what we have tinker so far. So, when winter break starts I want to try and communicate with my partner more during that time period of us not seeing each other in school.

#### Time Management

**Time management** is an important skill to have because we'll probably need to work on our projects over the break, so in order to make sure that everything goes smoothly my partner and I need to have good time management skills. Also, we need to have good time management skills since we are slowly going into the next steps within our engineering design process. Another reason in why time management is important because I don't want to do work last minute and be stress over about it. 

#### Organization

I realize that I need to be **organize** when working on the Freedom Project because I need to organize time with my tinkering, but I also need to organize time for my partner. I need to organize time for them since we are working together on this game. I want to make time for them because than we could start discussing which parts we want to do for our project. We can give each other somewhat of a role so that we can slowly build the bigger picture of our project.

#### Leadership

Having **leadership** is an important skill to have because I need to support my partner, since this project is a team effort and I don't want no one to be left behind. My partner and I need to make these steps together as a whole in order to make our project.

### Goal

I want my partner and I to start tinkering together and to start making a mini verson of our main game. Maybe we can start by making one of the mini games that we need for our main game. Or we can start making the backgrounds, and the designs that we want to use for the game. If not, I want to at least see the progress that my partner made. 

### Professionalism

I'm conveying my learning by using all the things that I have learnt from the past and today [``Computer Science 9th, SEP10, & SEP11``] by learning, from **Tiny.cc/fccwd**, from **Html**, from **JavaScript**, from **Markdown**, and from my friends/peers as well. I have learnt many different kinds of coding and format, and how to use them as well. I am using all of my learning, and coding skills in order to make this first blog. I have used some of the **html**, as well I used some of the **markdown**. For instance, I used this ``*`` to make my words in bold, and I used ``_`` in order to make some words in italic.
