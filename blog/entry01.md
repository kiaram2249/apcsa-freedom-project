### Content

This year in **APCSA**, my partner and I will be making an **educational simulation** about the **environment** as our Freedom Project. We'll be using a tool called ``Godot``, which is a game engine that allows us to create interactive and engaging experiences. Unlike last year's projects, where many students made games or wedsites, this year my partner and I will be focusing on programming and simulation development. Our goal is to teach players about environmental awareness and how different actions can impact the planet. Both my partner and I will be learning how to use ``Godot`` features like **scenes**, **scripting**, and **animations** to bring our simulation to life and make it both fun and educational.

### Godot 

``Godot`` is the tool that I will be learning and tinkering with over these months so that I can use the skills I learn to incorporate into our **environmental simulation** game. I wanted to learn ``Godot`` because it's free and open-source game engine that supports both **2D** and **3D** game development, and it uses its own scripting language called **GDScript**, which is similar to **Python**. I thought this would be a great tool to use since it allows us to build interactive enironments and realistic simulations that can help teach players about environmental issues. So far, I've started exploring ``Godot`` by going through tutorials on the offcial ``Godot`` website and watching **YouTube** videos that explain how different features work, like **nodes**, **scenes**, and **animations**. I also used a web editor that ``Godot`` haves: [Godot Web Editor](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/latest/). These resources have been really helpful because they provide examples and step-by-step guides that make it easier to understand how to build a project from scratch. This is my way of tinkering and learning how to use ``Godot`` effectively for our Freedom Project. However, since I was using my chrome laptop I wasn't able to do much, but now I got myself a window laptop from that school. Now I'm able to do much more with ``Godot``. 

### Environmental Simulation

When my partner and I were thinking about what kind of project to make for our Freedon Project, it wasn't actually hard to decide. We wanted to create something that could be both fun and educational at the same time. After talking about different topics, we started thinking about environment and how important it is for people to understand how their actions affect nature. That's when we came up with the idea of making an **environmental simulation**. In this simulation, players will be able to see how different desicions like recycling, planting trees, or using renewable energy, impact the planet over time. We thought this idea was meaningful because it can help teach players about taking care of the environment in an interactive and engaging way.

### Engineering Design Process

Right now, I'm at step 2, which is researching. I wouldn't really say I'm in step 1 anymore because my partner and I already have a clear idea of what we want to create, an **environmental simulation** game. So now, my main focus is researching my tool, ``Godot``. I need to find reliable sources, tutorials, and videos that can help me learn how to use ``Godot`` effectively. I've been looking into how **scenes**, **nodes**, and **GDScript** work so that I can understand how to build to basics of our simulation. I'm also starting to think a little bit ahead about step 3, which is brainstorming. My partner and I will soon need to brainstorm ideas about how our simulation will look, what features it will have, and how players will interact with the environment. But for now, my main goal is to keep researching and tinkering with ``Godot`` until I feel confident enough to start putting those ideas into action. 

### Skills

##### Collaboration

I will be learning the skill of **collaboration** because for this year's Freedom Project my partner and I will be working together to make out **environmental simulation** game. I need to learn this skill because creating a game takes teamwork, communication, and shared responsibility. It can't just be one person doing everything while the other watches, that wouldn't be fair or effective. **Collaboration** will help us combine our strengths, share ideas, and solve problems together when challenges come up. I also want to remind myself that working as a term will not only make the project easier but also make it more creative and enjoyable. That's why I really want to focus on improving my **collaboration** skills so that my partner and I can make the best simulation possible.

##### How To Learn

**How to learn** is an important skill that I need to develop because I need to understand how to use my, ``Godot``. I need to find reliable sources, tutorials, and examples that can help me learn and master how to use it. If I don't take the time to really learn my tool, then by the end of the year, I won't be able to use it properly for our Freedom Project. I don't want to make the same mistake as in **SEP 10**, when I didn't learn my tool well enough and struggled later on. This time, I want to make sure I understand ``Godot``, how to understand the coding, **scenes**, and **nodes** work. So that I know which functions and features I can use to make our **environmental simulation** successful. 

##### Communication

**Communication** is a very important skill for my partner and I because even though we are in the same class, we still need to communicate outside of school. There will be times when we want to work on our Freedom Project during the weekends or holidays, and to do that, we need to stay in touch and make sure everyone knows what's going on. Good **communication** helps us stay organized, share updates, and make sure no one is behind or confused about what to do next. That's why I will be contecting my partner on **Discord** since we both use it and check it often. We can use **Discord** to talk about the ideas, share our progress, or ask for help when we're not in class. This way, we can always stay connected and keep our project moving forward together. 

### Professionalism

I'm conveying my learning by using all the things that I have learnt from the past and today [``Computer Science 9th, SEP10, & SEP11``] by learning, from **Tiny.cc/fccwd**, from **Html**, from **JavaScript**, from **Markdown**, and from my friends/peers as well. I have learnt many different kinds of coding and format, and how to use them as well. I am using all of my learning, and coding skills in order to make this first blog. I have used some of the **html**, as well I used some of the **markdown**. For instance, I used this ``*`` to make my words in bold, and I used ``_`` in order to make some words in italic.
