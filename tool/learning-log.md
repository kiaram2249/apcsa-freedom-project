**Introduction to Godot**

* I was trying to install **Gobot** onto my school chrome computer, but I was very confused in how to input it into my **IDE**. So, I search [Godot Web Editor](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/latest/)

* Installed Godot for the first time.

Launched the Godot Editor and explored the interface.

Created my first project (named: MyFirstGame).

Added a new scene and experimented with some nodes like Node2D, Sprite2D
