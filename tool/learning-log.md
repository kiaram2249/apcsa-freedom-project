**Introduction to Godot**

* I was trying to install **Gobot** onto my school chrome computer, but I was very confused in how to input it into my **IDE**. So, I search [Godot Web Editor](https://editor.godotengine.org/releases/latest/), in order to use **Godot**. By using this editor I was able to start my new project, however using this editor I wasn't really downloading or setting **Godot** on to my laptop. I'll try and do that tommorrow, cause I need a little help in setting it up.
  
* Anyways, I was able to use the editor and I created a file called **MyFirstProject**. Once I created my file from the wed editor, I decided to focus on learning how to function **2D mode**.
    * I went and learned how to make my first **Scene** and **Sprite**.
      * How I created my **sprite**:
        * I needed to go to **Scene panel** and click `Node2D`. Once I did that I needed to click **Add Child Node** and search `Sprite2D`.
      * The **sprite** would appear underneath my `Node2D`.
        * Since I now have my `Sprite2D`, I can finally add an image to the **sprite**.
          * I needed to drag and drop `icon.svg` onto the `Sprite2D` node or into the Texture field in the Inspector in order to print out the image. When I did that a little Godot robot head appear in the 2D view.
